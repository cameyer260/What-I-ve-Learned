What I’ve Learned

What I’ve Learned is a collection of insights, lessons, and solutions I’ve gathered over time as a software developer. It serves as a living record of the challenges I encounter while building projects and the solutions I discover along the way.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource — both for myself and for others — to help solve real-world software development problems. For example, if a developer needs to convert PDFs to images on a Node.js server but can’t find a reliable library, they can refer to this repository to see how I approached and solved that issue.

Each documented solution aims to contribute back to the developer community by making problem-solving knowledge more accessible. In an era where many technical solutions are found through private interactions with AI tools or isolated research, valuable discoveries often go unseen. This repository seeks to preserve that knowledge in a public and practical way.

While it won’t capture everything I’ve learned, the goal is for it to eventually represent a substantial portion of my experience as a developer — providing a meaningful reference for others to learn from, build upon, and improve their own craft.

Traditionally, a developer might encounter a problem, research extensively, and eventually find a fix through a mix of documentation, forums, or AI assistance. But once the issue is resolved, the solution often disappears — undocumented and forgotten. What I’ve Learned aims to change that by offering a simple, informal space to record and share these findings.

Documenting solutions not only benefits others but also deepens understanding. By taking the time to articulate how a problem was solved, developers reinforce their learning and retain that knowledge for future projects.
